		My name is Chris.  I was born and raised in and around Red Sox Nation. Now, my family and I call the Raleigh area home, and love it.  There are a lot of great photo locations here.  I have a Wife and a 5 year old Son who’s had a camera in his face since he was 5 seconds old.  Needless to say, he's quite photogenic. <br>

Photography has been in my life for over 20 years, but I don’t do it for a living.  I have a full-time career as an IT professional, and I’m not looking to change careers at this point.  I do photography because I love it.  I've been through film, Polaroid, point and shoots, and now DSLR.  I have passion for all types of photography.  Whether it is capturing a special event, creating something of my own, traveling to foreign countries or snapping that candid. There's always another moment to be captured!<br> 

Passion is the motivation that makes me wake up at ungodly hours to place my camera at precise moments to create appealing, joyful and sometimes majestic photographs.  Creating new artwork is just a small part of my photography.  I also like to capture weddings, engagements, family and children portraits. <br>

If I had to give one word to my style of photography, then it would be “natural”.  I don’t like to add filters or change the colors to my photographs.  I do edit all my photographs, but mostly to improve the natural color or increase contrast and sharpness to make them pop. The clean and natural look of them will remain the same.  I shoot until the final result matches what I had for a vision or until I have captured the way my clients want to be portrayed.   I provide my clients direction to some interesting and creative photo ideas, but I like to keep my client’s involved and I encourage client suggestions.  I show my clients the photos from my camera during our session because it keeps them out of the dark of how their photos are coming out.  It also promotes excitement and confidence for future shots within the session.  I like to keep my sessions light and fun.  Warning, I may crack a joke in the middle of the shoot to provoke that “real” laugh or smile and snap away without you knowing.<br>

There are no rules in photography. My photography style may not be for everyone and that’s fine. Granted, photographers can be very expensive, but budgets are important as well and usually persuade people to choose a certain photographer over another.  You can get the most expensive photographer in the world, but if you don’t like his or her style, then you’re not going to like your photos.  So take the time to pick someone that is within your budget and fits your style that you are looking for.
